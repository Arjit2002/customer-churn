# customer-churn

This project aims to predict customer churn for a telecommunications company (Telco). Customer churn refers to the phenomenon where customers discontinue their services or switch to a competitor. By identifying potential churners in advance, the Telco can take proactive measures to retain those customers and mitigate the negative impact on their business.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains various attributes of Telco customers, including demographic information, services subscribed, and usage patterns. It also includes a target variable indicating whether a customer has churned or not. The dataset will be used for training and evaluating machine learning models to predict customer churn.
